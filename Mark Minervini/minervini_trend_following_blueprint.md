# Part 1: Core Risk Management Philosophy

## The 3 Key Facts About Losses

| Fact | Implication |
|------|-------------|
| **You WILL have losses** | Accept losses as part of the game; they're unavoidable |
| **Losses work geometrically against you** | A 50% loss needs 100% gain to recover |
| **Small losses = your ONLY protection** | The single most controllable edge you have |

## What You Control vs. What You Don't

| ✅ Direct Control | ❌ No Control |
|-------------------|---------------|
| What you buy | How much a stock goes up |
| When you buy | Frequency of wins (batting average) |
| How much you buy | |
| When you sell | |

**Key Insight:** You gain control over outcomes by managing what you CAN control.

# Part 2: The Holy Grail Formula (AWLR)

## Adjusted Win/Loss Ratio

```
AWLR = (Average Gain × % Winning Trades) / (Average Loss × % Losing Trades)
```

### Examples:
- **Example 1:** (10% × 50%) / (5% × 50%) = **2:1 AWLR**
- **Example 2:** (15% × 40%) / (5% × 60%) = **2:1 AWLR**

### The Trading Triangle
Three variables you can adjust:
1. **Average Gain** - Size of your winners
2. **Average Loss** - Size of your losers (most controllable!)
3. **Batting Average** - Percentage of winning trades

**Critical Insight:** You can compensate for lower batting average by improving your win/loss ratio.

# Part 3: Position Sizing Rules

## Core Position Sizing Parameters

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Maximum stop per trade | 8% (10-12% staggered) |
| Average loss target | 5-6% per trade |
| Maximum overnight position | 50% |
| Optimal position size | 20-25% |
| Number of positions | 4-5 big positions (8-16 stocks max including partials) |
| Risk of Total Equity (ROTE) | 1.00-1.50% (2.50% max) |

## ROTE Calculation Examples

All three scenarios = Same 1.25% portfolio risk:

| Position Size | Stop Loss | ROTE |
|---------------|-----------|------|
| 12.5% | 10% | 1.25% |
| 25% | 5% | 1.25% |
| 50% | 2.5% | 1.25% |

**Formula:** ROTE = Position Size × Stop Loss %

# Part 4: The "Mind-Blowing Math" 🤯

## Key Revelation: You Don't Need to Be in the Market All the Time!

### Scenario Analysis (253 trading days/year)

| Days with 2% Gain | Days Flat/Breakeven | Annual Return |
|-------------------|---------------------|---------------|
| 37 days (14.6%) | 216 days | **107%** |
| 27 days (10.7%) | 226 days | **70%** |
| 17 days (6.7%) | 236 days | **40%** |
| 13 days (5.1%) | 240 days | **30%** |

### The Math Behind It
- 25% position × 8% gain = **2% portfolio gain**
- Maintain 75% cash at ALL times
- Only need ~37 winning trades per year for 100%+ returns!

```
Number of winning days × Position Size × Gain = Annual Return
37 × 25% × 8% = 74% (simple) → 107% (compounded)
```

## The Power Factor (Compounding Effect)

| Year | Capital | 30% Gain | Dollar Gain | Ratio to Year 1 |
|------|---------|----------|-------------|-----------------|
| 1 | $100 | 30% | $30 | 1:1 |
| 2 | $130 | 30% | $39 | 1.3:1 |
| 3 | $169 | 30% | $50.70 | 1.7:1 |
| 4 | $219.70 | 30% | $65.91 | 2.2:1 |

**Insight:** Same percentage gain produces MORE dollars each year!

## Opportunity Cost: Smaller Gains Can Be Better

| Strategy | Total Return |
|----------|--------------|
| 1 × 100% | 100% |
| 4 × 20% | 107% |
| 8 × 10% | 114% |

**Why?** Compounding on smaller, more frequent wins beats one big winner.

# Part 5: Progressive Exposure System

## The Scale-Up/Scale-Down Framework

### When Starting (Pilot Buys)
1. Start with **quarter position** (6.25%)
2. DO NOT get aggressive until trades start working
3. Use profits to finance increased risk

### Progressive Position Ladder

| Trade # | Outcome | Position Size | Risk ($100K account) |
|---------|---------|---------------|---------------------|
| 1 | WIN | 6.25% (Quarter) | $500 |
| 2 | WIN | 12.5% (Half) | $1,000 |
| 3 | WIN | 25% (Full) | $2,000 |
| 4 | LOSS | 25% (Full) | ($2,000) |
| 5 | LOSS | 12.5% (Half) | ($1,000) |

**Golden Rule:** "Trade the largest when you're trading your best... and trade the smallest when you're trading your worst."

## 2:1 Reward/Risk Financing Rule

At 2:1 R/R, every win finances TWO losses:

| Trade | Stop Risk | Outcome | P&L | Running P&L |
|-------|-----------|---------|-----|-------------|
| 1 | $1,000 | Win (2R) | +$2,000 | +$2,000 |
| 2 | $1,000 | Loss | -$1,000 | +$1,000 |
| 3 | $1,000 | Loss | -$1,000 | **$0 (Breakeven)** |

# Part 6: Stop Loss Strategy

## Two Types of Stops

| Technical Stop | Mathematical Stop |
|----------------|-------------------|
| Based on chart structure | Based on % from entry |
| Support levels, patterns | Fixed 5%, 6%, 8% etc. |
| Where price "shouldn't go" | Risk/reward calculation |

**Best Practice:** Back into technical stops that make mathematical sense.

## Stop Loss Guidelines

| Stop Type | Percentage |
|-----------|------------|
| Very Tight | 3% or less |
| Average | 4-6% |
| Maximum | 7-8% |
| Uncle Point (staggered only) | 10-12% |

## Staggered/Bracketed Stops

| Half Position | Half Position | Average |
|---------------|---------------|---------|
| 6% stop | 10% stop | 8% average |
| 4% stop | 12% stop | 8% average |

# Part 7: Trading Priorities

## The Priority Hierarchy

```
1. CUT YOUR LOSS ←————— First Priority (survival)
        ↓
2. PROTECT YOUR LINE ←— Second Priority (breakeven)
        ↓
3. PROTECT YOUR PROFIT ← Third Priority (lock gains)
```

## Trade Management Steps

1. **Define your risk** - Know stop BEFORE entry
2. **Move stop to breakeven ASAP** - Eliminate risk
3. **Protect decent gains** - Never let winners become losers

## The "Sell Half" Win/Win Strategy

When at **multiple of risk** AND **above average gain**:
1. Sell half position
2. Move stop to breakeven on remainder
3. **Option A:** Free-roll to your original stop
4. **Option B:** Free-roll to breakeven

# Part 8: Difficult Market Adjustments

## When Markets Get Hostile

| Adjustment | Normal | Difficult Market |
|------------|--------|------------------|

| Profit Target | 15-20% | 10-12% |
| Leverage | OK with margin | NO MARGIN |
| Position Size | Normal | Reduced |
| Exposure | Normal | Reduced |

## Root Causes of Trading Failure

| Faulty Principles | Faulty Discipline |
|-------------------|-------------------|
| Wrong criteria | Not following your own rules |
| Flawed strategy | Emotional decisions |
| Poor assumptions | "Just this one time" moments |

# Part 12: Practical Implementation Blueprint

## Daily Checklist

### Before Every Buy
Ask yourself: **"If I could only make 10 trades per year, would this be one of them?"**

### Before Every Sell
Ask yourself: **"How is this going to look on my spreadsheet?"**

### Daily Position Review (3 Questions)
1. Would I buy this stock now?
2. If not, why am I holding it?
3. Where am I a seller?

## Trade Planning Template

```
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
TRADE PLAN: [SYMBOL]
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
Date: ___________
Entry Price: ___________
Position Size: ___________ (% of portfolio)

STOP LOSS PLAN:
□ Initial Stop: ___________ (-___%)
□ ROTE Check: ___________ (must be <2.5%)

PROFIT TARGETS:
□ First target (sell half): ___________ (+___%)
□ Second target: ___________ (+___%)

CONTINGENCIES:
□ Move stop to breakeven when: ___________
□ Disaster plan (gap down): ___________
□ Re-entry plan if stopped: ___________
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
```

## Position Sizing Calculator

```
Step 1: Determine acceptable ROTE (1-2.5% max)
Step 2: Determine technical stop level
Step 3: Calculate position size:

Position Size = ROTE / Stop Loss %

Example:
- ROTE = 1.5%
- Stop Loss = 6%
- Position Size = 1.5% / 6% = 25%
```
