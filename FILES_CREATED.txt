OpenAlgo Integration - Files Created
====================================

Python Modules (7 files):
✓ bridge_config.py          - Configuration management
✓ bridge_state.py           - Position state with persistence  
✓ bridge_utils.py           - Utility functions (ATM, expiry, market hours)
✓ openalgo_client.py        - OpenAlgo REST API client
✓ position_sizer.py         - Position sizing calculator
✓ synthetic_executor.py     - Synthetic futures execution + partial fill protection
✓ openalgo_bridge.py        - Main Flask application (webhook receiver)

Configuration:
✓ openalgo_config.json      - Bridge configuration
✓ requirements_openalgo.txt - Python dependencies (Flask, requests)

Documentation:
✓ README_OPENALGO.md        - Complete setup and usage guide
✓ SETUP_OPENALGO.md         - Quick start reference  
✓ IMPLEMENTATION_COMPLETE.md - Implementation status and architecture
✓ FILES_CREATED.txt         - This file

Auto-Generated (at runtime):
□ position_state.json       - Live position tracking (created when bridge starts)
□ openalgo_bridge.log       - Application logs (created when bridge starts)

Total Lines of Code: ~1,200 lines

Next Steps:
1. Install OpenAlgo: git clone https://github.com/marketcalls/openalgo.git
2. Configure: Edit openalgo_config.json with API key
3. Install deps: pip install -r requirements_openalgo.txt
4. Test: python openalgo_bridge.py
5. Verify: curl http://localhost:5001/health

Critical Features Implemented:
✓ Partial fill protection (PE first, then CE, emergency cover)
✓ Exit uses entry strike (not current ATM)
✓ Market hours validation (9:15-15:25 IST)
✓ Duplicate signal prevention (60-second window)
✓ Position state persistence (survives restarts)
✓ Comprehensive logging
✓ Position sizing (risk-based + triple-constraint)
✓ Synthetic futures execution (SELL PE + BUY CE)

Ready for Testing!
